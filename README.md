## Overview
### The Challenge
My challenge was to build a todo app where you can add, edit, and delete tasks. (Note: Mobile friendly and responsive!)

### Project Features
The features included are:
- **Check Button**: a toggle that crosses a task off the list; it can also be uncrossed
- **Delete Button**: delete a task 
- **Edit Button**: edit a task
- **Clear Button**: clear the entire list

## My Process

### Built With

- Love ðŸ’–
- Semantic HTML5 Markup
- CSS Flexbox & CSS Grid
- CSS Custom Properties
- Vanilla JS
- Mobile-first Workflow

### What I Learned
The main aim of this project was to practice writing my own JavaScript functions, from scratch, and to try and make them as efficient as possible. I'd like to say I succeeded in that aspect! I will continue making progress by writing more complex functions in future projects :)

### Useful Resources
- [developedbyed's YT tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttf3CEsEwMQ): I took inspiration from this tutorial by ed on YouTube for the base of this project
